### For Staff/Admin
To add session images and medical documentation:

   - Add metadata: procedure type, dentist, date, description
   - Images automatically appear in patient's profile
   - Grouped by treatment session
   
2. **Image Data Structure**:
   ```javascript
   {
     id: 'img123',
     patientId: 'pat001',
     sessionId: 'session001',
     sessionTitle: 'Teeth Whitening',
     imageUrl: 'data:image/jpeg;base64,...',
     type: 'Before' or 'After',
     label: 'Front View',
     procedure: 'Teeth Whitening',
     dentist: 'Dr. Smith',
     date: '2025-01-15',
     description: 'Initial consultation photos',
     uploadedAt: '2025-01-15T10:30:00'
   }
   ```

3. **Add Medical Notes/Remarks**:
   - When marking an appointment as "completed"
   - Add remarks and treatment notes
   - These automatically appear in patient's chart

## Technical Details

### Session Images Storage
Stored in localStorage under `clinicData.sessionImages`:
- Filtered by `patientId` for security
- Each image contains full metadata
- Grouped by `sessionId` for organization
- Base64 encoded images for easy storage

### Patient Chart Data Structure  
The patient chart pulls from completed appointments with fields:
- `status`: Must be "completed" 
- `remarks`: Treatment notes (optional)
- `treatment`: Treatment description (optional)
- `date`, `time`, `serviceId`, `doctorId`: Standard appointment info

### Display Rules
- **Session Images**: Only visible to associated patient
- **Patient Chart**: Only shows completed appointments
- **Sorting**: Both sorted by date (newest first)
- **Counts**: Dynamic count badges for records and images
- **Empty States**: User-friendly placeholders when no data exists

## Design Theme
- **Colors**: Black (#000000), Gold (#D4AF37, #FFD700), White (#FFFFFF)
- **Style**: Luxury dental/medical aesthetic with gradients
- **Gallery**: Responsive grid with 4:3 aspect ratio photos
- **Image Viewer**: Full-screen modal with detailed metadata
- **Hover Effects**: 
  - Gold glow on cards and images
  - Smooth scale transforms
  - Overlay animations
- **Badges**: Gold gradient for "Before/After" labels
- **Responsive**: Fully mobile-friendly, single column on mobile

## Sample Test Data for Session Images

Use `Storage.createSessionImage()` in console:
```javascript
Storage.createSessionImage({
  patientId: 'pat001',
  sessionId: 'session001',
  sessionTitle: 'Teeth Whitening Session 1',
  imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
  type: 'Before',
  label: 'Front View',
  procedure: 'Teeth Whitening',

```
